# Philosophical Prelude: What is Probability? {-}

John Stuart Mill laid out a fundamentally relativistic program for
understanding the nature of probability statements,^[Mill, John
Stuart.  1882.  *A System of Logic: Raciocinative and Inductive*.
Eighth edition. Harper & Brothers, Publishers, New York. Part III,
Chapter 18.]

> We must remember that the probability of an event is not a quality
of the event itself, but a mere name for the degree of ground which
we, or some one else, have for expecting it. $\ldots$ Every event is
in itself certain, not probable; if we knew all, we should either know
positively that it will happen, or positively that it will not. But
its probability to us means the degree of expectation of its
occurrence, which we are warranted in entertaining by our present
evidence.

Our estimate of the probability of an event fundamentally depends on
how much we know.  For example, if you ask me now to forecast the
weather on a random day in Edinburgh next year, I'll forecast 52%
because it rains on average 191 days per year in Edinburgh.^[World
Weather and Climate (2018) [Edinburgh
rainfall](https://weather-and-climate.com/average-monthly-Rainy-days,Edinburgh-uk,Scotland).]
If I know the day is in December, I'll make an estimate of 65%
conditioned on knowing that the day is in December and it rains on
average 20 days in December.  Continuing to add information, if it's
December 14 and I have up-to-date radar and I have to estimate whether
it's going to rain on December 15, then the number might be anything,
depending on the current meteorological conditions.

Fundamentally, probability is a relative measure of uncertainty
conditioned on available information.  In other words, probability
involves statements about an agent's or collection of agents'
knowledge of the world, not about the world directly.^[In
philosophical terms, the nature of probability is *epistemic* rather
than *ontological*.]  This allows us to believe the world is
deterministic,^[We may consistently side with Einstein in believing
God does not play dice.] while still reasoning probabilistically based
on available evidence.

Probability theory merely provides a mathematically consistent
approach to quantifying uncertainty and performing inductive
inference.
