# Markov Chain Monte Carlo

*Monte Carlo methods*^[Monte Carlo methods are so-called because of
the Monte Carlo Casino (shown below), located in the Principality of
Monaco. <br /> &nbsp; <br /> ![](img/mc-casino.jpg) <span

processes to calculate numerical solutions to definite integrals in
high dimensions.  

## Markov chains

A sequence of random variables $Y = Y_1, Y_2, \ldots $ forms a *Markov
chain* if each element of the sequence is conditionally independent
given the previous element,

$$
p(y_n \mid y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_{n-1})
=
p(y_n \mid y_{n-1}).
$$
