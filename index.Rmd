# About this Book {-}

This book provides a short, accessible introduction to applied
probabilistic modeling and statistical inference, with the intention
of training practitioners to draw sound inferences from noisy
measurements.^[Application areas include the physical, biological and
social sciences, engineering, business and finance, education,
government, and sport---anywhere there is data from which we want to
draw conclusions or make decisions.]  It differs from other books
covering the same material in that it

* is short, top-down, and example-driven;
* assumes only introductory-level mathematics and
 computation;^[Specifically, some familiarity with integral calculus
 and exposure to basic programming concepts.]
* develops probability theory and statistical inference through simulation;
* takes an unapologetically Bayesian approach to modeling and inference;
* is fully reproducible with open-source code, figures, and text.
