# Preface {-}

This book provides a short, accessible introduction to *applied*
probabilistic modeling and statistical inference.^[Application areas
include the physical, biological and social sciences, engineering,
business and finance, education, government, and sport---anywhere
there is data from which we want to draw conclusions or make
decisions.]


## Goal {-}

After reading this book, you should have a solid grasp of how to draw
sound inferences from noisy measurements and how to make reasoned
decisions in the face of uncertainty.


## Approach {-}

This book differs from other books covering similar material in that
it

* is short, top-down, and example-driven;
* assumes only introductory-level mathematics and
 computation;^[Specifically, this book assumes some familiarity
 with algebra, integral calculus, and exposure to basic programming
 concepts.]
* develops probability theory and statistical inference through simulation;
* takes an unapologetically Bayesian approach to modeling and inference;
* is fully reproducible with open-source code, figures, and text.
