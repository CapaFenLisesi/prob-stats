# Statistical Inference and Inverse Problems

*Deductive inference* works from facts toward conclusions
determinstically.  For example, if I tell you that all men are mortal
and that Socrates is a man, you can deductively conclude that Socrates
is mortal.  *Inductive inference*, on the other hand, is a bit more
slippery to define, as it works from observations back to facts.  That
is, if we think of the facts as governing or generating the
observations, then induction is a kind of inverse inference.
*Statistical inference* is a kind of inductive inference that is
specifically formulated as an inverse problem.

## Laplace's inverse problem of birth ratios

The roots of statistical inference lie not in games of chance, but in
the realm of public health.  Pierre-Simon Laplace was investigating
the rate of child births by sex in France in an attempt to predict
future population sizes.^[Pierre-Simon Laplace. 1812. *Essai
philosophique sur les probabilitÃ©s*. H. Remy. p. lvi of the
Introduction.  Annotated English translation of the 1825 Fifth
Edition: Andrew I. Dale, 1995. *Philosophical Essay on
Probabilities*. Springer-Verlag.]  Laplace reports the following
number of live births, gathered from thirty departments of France
between 1800 and 1802 was as follows.

$$
\begin{array}[r|r]
{ } \mbox{sex} & \mbox{live births}
\\ \hline
\mbox{male} & 110\,312
\\
\mbox{female} & 105\,287
\end{array}
$$

Laplace assumed each birth was an independent event with an unknown
probability $\Theta \in [0, 1]$ of being a boy that did not vary among
the births.  Letting $Y$ be the number of male births and $N$ be the
total number of births, Laplace assumed the model

$$
Y  \sim \mbox{binomial}(N, \Theta).
$$

Laplace was faced with the *inverse problem* of drawing inferences
about $\Theta$ based on observations about $Y$.


## What is a model?

We say that this simple formula is a *model* in the sense that it is
not the actual birth process, but rather a mathematical construct
meant to reflect properties of the birth process.  In this sense, it's
like Newton's model of the planetary motions using differential
equations.  It will allow us to predict certain things, but it is not
even a completely realistic or fully detailed description of the
process at hand.^[Conception through to birth is a complex process and
may depend on any number of factors; planetary motion as described by
Newon is only an approximation to the relativistic model, which itself
is presumably still only an approximation.]  Newton's model is better
than the ball-and-string type model of Copernicus, in the sense that
it is better at prediction.

So when we say "model", we mean a mathematical construct meant to
represent some aspect of reality.  Whether a model is useful is a
pragmatic question, often judged by its ability to make useful and
replicable predictions.  Other factors include whether it provides
insight into underlying processes---a matter more of elegance than
predictive accuracy.


## What is a random variable?

As in all statistical modeling, Laplace treated the observed number of
male births $Y$ as a random variable.  This assumes a form of
counterfactual reasoning whereby we assume the world might have been
some other way than it actually turned out to be.

As in most statistical models, Laplace treated $N$ as a constant.  In
many cases, the denominator of binary events is not itself a constant,
but is itself a random variable determined by factors of the
environment.  For instance, the number of attempts an athlete on a
sports team get depends on the ability of that athlete and the number
of reviews a movie receives depends on its popularity.

As originally formulated by Thomas Bayes,^[Bayes, T., 1763. LII. An
essay towards solving a problem in the doctrine of chances. By the
late Rev. Mr. Bayes, FRS communicated by Mr. Price, in a letter to
John Canton, AMFRS. *Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society*, pp. 370--418.]
Laplace also treated $\Theta$ as a random variable.  That is, Laplace
wanted to infer, based on observation and measurement, that the
probability that $\Theta$'s value was in a certain range.
Specifically, Laplace was curious about the question of whether the
male birth rate is higher, which can be expressed in probabilistic
terms by the event probability $\mbox{Pr}[\Theta > 0.5]$.
